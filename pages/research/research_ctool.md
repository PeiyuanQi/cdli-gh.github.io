##Corpus analysis tools review
<b>1.  PML Tree Query - </b>
Cons: 
-   Requires Treex installation, web version is suitable only for
    teaching and Demonstration
-   Limited publicly available treebanks
-   Following strict universal dependency structure could be difficult
    for CDLI data
    
<b>2.  Corpus Workbench / Ziggurat - </b>
Pros: 
-   The IMS Open Corpus Workbench(CWB) is a collection of open corpus tools for managing and querying large text corpora with linguistic annotations <br/>
Cons: 
-   Donâ€™t know if new version added Unicode support
-   Not supported on Windows

<b>3.  XML DB with own SVG frontend - </b>
-   SVGs are a good option
-   Dot / Graphviz is a promising approach but would involve persistent
    XML DB

<b>4.  SPARQL endpoint with visualization - </b>
Cons: 
-   SPARQL endpoint is an ephemeral and unstable way to share data
    https://daverog.wordpress.com/2013/06/04/the-enduring-myth-of-the-sparql-endpoint/
-   Requires data to be stored in RDF format
-   Preferable for key-value kind of data

<b>5.  ANNIS (Annotation of Information Structure) - </b>
Pros: 
-   Cross platform
-   Browser based search
-   Visualization architecture for complex, multilayer linguistic
    corpora
-   Concurrently annotate, query and visualize data from varied areas
    such as Syntax, morphology, semantics, etc. <br/>    
Cons: 
-   Rejected as it is in Java and would have to be queried like an API
-   Embedding the search results in the site could be problematic<br/>
<b>6.  Other suggestions -</b>
