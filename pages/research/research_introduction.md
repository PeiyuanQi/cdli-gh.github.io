## Introduction to the research process documentation




## What is the team working on?
Our code rests on Github at: <https://github.com/cdhi-gh>   
Our private Google drive lives here (staff only): <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8-deXARunnhU2FHVzVqLXA4N3M>  


We are keeping track of tasks using GitHub issues. We also have a Kaban board to sort the tasks and a Gantt chart to track them over time. Each user assigned to a task is responsible for keeping their issue(s) updated.  

Creating a new issue on GitHub uses a template that contains keywords which will enable the issue to be displayed on the Gantt chart.   

### MTAAC Project
All tasks that directly affect MTAAC will go into this repository. Virtualization and mirroring of the CDLI servers will live here too.

Tasks (in the form of GitHub issues): <https://github.com/cdli-gh/mtaac_work/issues>  
Kaban board of the issues: <https://waffle.io/cdli-gh/mtaac_work>  
MTAAC tasks Gantt chart: <http://cdli-dev.org/gantt/mtaac_work/>  

### Framework
All tasks that pertain to the development of the CDLI software platform except high-level design should appear here. Any problems with CDLI in its current version (2017-2018) should also appear here.

Tasks (in the form of GitHub issues): <https://github.com/cdli-gh/Framework/issues>  
Kaban board of the issues: <https://waffle.io/cdli-gh/Framework>  
Framework tasks Gantt chart: <http://cdli-dev.org/gantt/Framework/>
